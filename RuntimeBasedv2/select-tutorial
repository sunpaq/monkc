DESCRIPTION
       select() (or pselect()) is used to efficiently monitor multiple file descriptors, to see if any of them is, or becomes, "ready";
       that is, to see whether I/O becomes possible, or an "exceptional condition" has occurred on any of the descriptors.

       Its principal arguments are three "sets" of file descriptors: readfds, writefds, and exceptfds.  Each set is  declared  as  type
       fd_set, and its contents can be manipulated with the macros FD_CLR(), FD_ISSET(), FD_SET(), and FD_ZERO().  A newly declared set
       should first be cleared using FD_ZERO().  select() modifies the contents of the sets according to  the  rules  described  below;
       after  calling  select()  you  can  test  if  a file descriptor is still present in a set with the FD_ISSET() macro.  FD_ISSET()
       returns nonzero if a specified file descriptor is present in a set and zero if it is not.  FD_CLR() removes  a  file  descriptor
       from a set.

   Arguments
       readfds
              This  set  is  watched  to  see  if  data  is available for reading from any of its file descriptors.  After select() has
              returned, readfds will be cleared of all file descriptors except for those that are immediately available for reading.

       writefds
              This set is watched to see if there is space to write data to any of its file descriptors.  After select() has  returned,
              writefds will be cleared of all file descriptors except for those that are immediately available for writing.

       exceptfds
              This set is watched for "exceptional conditions".  In practice, only one such exceptional condition is common: the avail‐
              ability of out-of-band (OOB) data for reading from a TCP socket.  See recv(2), send(2), and tcp(7) for more details about
              OOB data.  (One other less common case where select(2) indicates an exceptional condition occurs with pseudo-terminals in
              packet mode; see tty_ioctl(4).)  After select() has returned, exceptfds will be cleared of all  file  descriptors  except
              for those for which an exceptional condition has occurred.

       nfds   This  is  an  integer  one more than the maximum of any file descriptor in any of the sets.  In other words, while adding
              file descriptors to each of the sets, you must calculate the maximum integer value of all of them,  then  increment  this
              value by one, and then pass this as nfds.

       utimeout
              This  is  the  longest  time  select() may wait before returning, even if nothing interesting happened.  If this value is
              passed as NULL, then select() blocks indefinitely waiting for a file descriptor to become ready.  utimeout can be set  to
              zero  seconds,  which  causes select() to return immediately, with information about the readiness of file descriptors at
              the time of the call.  The structure struct timeval is defined as:

                  struct timeval {
                      time_t tv_sec;    /* seconds */
                      long tv_usec;     /* microseconds */
                  };

       ntimeout
              This argument for pselect() has the same meaning as utimeout, but struct timespec has nanosecond precision as follows:

                  struct timespec {
                      long tv_sec;    /* seconds */
                      long tv_nsec;   /* nanoseconds */
                  };

       sigmask
              This argument holds a set of signals that the kernel should unblock (i.e., remove from the signal  mask  of  the  calling
              thread), while the caller is blocked inside the pselect() call (see sigaddset(3) and sigprocmask(2)).  It may be NULL, in
              which case the call does not modify the signal mask on entry and exit to the function.  In this case, pselect() will then
              behave just like select().

   Combining Signal and Data Events
       pselect()  is  useful  if you are waiting for a signal as well as for file descriptor(s) to become ready for I/O.  Programs that
       receive signals normally use the signal handler only to raise a global flag.  The global flag will indicate that the event  must
       be  processed in the main loop of the program.  A signal will cause the select() (or pselect()) call to return with errno set to
       EINTR.  This behavior is essential so that signals can be processed in the main loop of the program,  otherwise  select()  would
       block  indefinitely.  Now, somewhere in the main loop will be a conditional to check the global flag.  So we must ask: what if a
       signal arrives after the conditional, but before the select() call?  The answer is that select() would block indefinitely,  even
       though  an  event  is  actually pending.  This race condition is solved by the pselect() call.  This call can be used to set the
       signal mask to a set of signals that are only to be received within the pselect() call.  For instance, let us say that the event
       in  question  was  the exit of a child process.  Before the start of the main loop, we would block SIGCHLD using sigprocmask(2).
       Our pselect() call would enable SIGCHLD by using an empty signal mask.  Our program would look like:

       static volatile sig_atomic_t got_SIGCHLD = 0;

       static void
       child_sig_handler(int sig)
       {
           got_SIGCHLD = 1;
       }

       int
       main(int argc, char *argv[])
       {
           sigset_t sigmask, empty_mask;
           struct sigaction sa;
           fd_set readfds, writefds, exceptfds;
           int r;

           sigemptyset(&sigmask);
           sigaddset(&sigmask, SIGCHLD);
           if (sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, &sigmask, NULL) == -1) {
               perror("sigprocmask");
               exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
           }

           sa.sa_flags = 0;
           sa.sa_handler = child_sig_handler;
           sigemptyset(&sa.sa_mask);
           if (sigaction(SIGCHLD, &sa, NULL) == -1) {
               perror("sigaction");
               exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
           }

           sigemptyset(&empty_mask);

           for (;;) {          /* main loop */
               /* Initialize readfds, writefds, and exceptfds
                  before the pselect() call. (Code omitted.) */

               r = pselect(nfds, &readfds, &writefds, &exceptfds,
                           NULL, &empty_mask);
               if (r == -1 && errno != EINTR) {
                   /* Handle error */
               }

               if (got_SIGCHLD) {
                   got_SIGCHLD = 0;

                   /* Handle signalled event here; e.g., wait() for all
                      terminated children. (Code omitted.) */
               }

               /* main body of program */
           }
       }

   Practical
       So what is the point of select()?  Can't I just read and write to my descriptors whenever I want?  The point of select() is that
       it  watches multiple descriptors at the same time and properly puts the process to sleep if there is no activity.  Unix program‐
       mers often find themselves in a position where they have to handle I/O from more than one file descriptor where  the  data  flow
       may  be  intermittent.   If  you were to merely create a sequence of read(2) and write(2) calls, you would find that one of your
       calls may block waiting for data from/to a file descriptor, while another file  descriptor  is  unused  though  ready  for  I/O.
       select() efficiently copes with this situation.

   Select Law
       Many  people who try to use select() come across behavior that is difficult to understand and produces nonportable or borderline
       results.  For instance, the above program is carefully written not to block at any point, even though it does not set  its  file
       descriptors  to  nonblocking  mode.   It is easy to introduce subtle errors that will remove the advantage of using select(), so
       here is a list of essentials to watch for when using select().

       1.  You should always try to use select() without a timeout.  Your program should have nothing to do if there is no data  avail‐
           able.  Code that depends on timeouts is not usually portable and is difficult to debug.

       2.  The value nfds must be properly calculated for efficiency as explained above.

       3.  No  file  descriptor  must be added to any set if you do not intend to check its result after the select() call, and respond
           appropriately.  See next rule.

       4.  After select() returns, all file descriptors in all sets should be checked to see if they are ready.

       5.  The functions read(2), recv(2), write(2), and send(2) do not necessarily read/write the full amount of data  that  you  have
           requested.   If they do read/write the full amount, it's because you have a low traffic load and a fast stream.  This is not
           always going to be the case.  You should cope with the case of your functions only managing to  send  or  receive  a  single
           byte.

       6.  Never  read/write only in single bytes at a time unless you are really sure that you have a small amount of data to process.
           It is extremely inefficient not to read/write as much data as you can buffer each time.  The buffers in  the  example  below
           are 1024 bytes although they could easily be made larger.

       7.  The functions read(2), recv(2), write(2), and send(2) as well as the select() call can return -1 with errno set to EINTR, or
           with errno set to EAGAIN (EWOULDBLOCK).  These results must be properly managed (not done properly above).  If your  program
           is  not going to receive any signals, then it is unlikely you will get EINTR.  If your program does not set nonblocking I/O,
           you will not get EAGAIN.

       8.  Never call read(2), recv(2), write(2), or send(2) with a buffer length of zero.

       9.  If the functions read(2), recv(2), write(2), and send(2) fail with errors other than those listed in 7., or one of the input
           functions  returns  0,  indicating  end of file, then you should not pass that descriptor to select() again.  In the example
           below, I close the descriptor immediately, and then set it to -1 to prevent it being included in a set.

       10. The timeout value must be initialized with each new call to select(), since some operating  systems  modify  the  structure.
           pselect() however does not modify its timeout structure.

       11. Since  select()  modifies its file descriptor sets, if the call is being used in a loop, then the sets must be reinitialized
           before each call.

   Usleep Emulation
       On systems that do not have a usleep(3) function, you can call select() with a finite timeout and no file  descriptors  as  fol‐
       lows:

           struct timeval tv;
           tv.tv_sec = 0;
           tv.tv_usec = 200000;  /* 0.2 seconds */
           select(0, NULL, NULL, NULL, &tv);

       This is only guaranteed to work on Unix systems, however.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, select() returns the total number of file descriptors still present in the file descriptor sets.

       If select() timed out, then the return value will be zero.  The file descriptors set should be all empty (but may not be on some
       systems).

       A return value of -1 indicates an error, with errno being set appropriately.  In the case of  an  error,  the  contents  of  the
       returned sets and the struct timeout contents are undefined and should not be used.  pselect() however never modifies ntimeout.

NOTES
       Generally  speaking, all operating systems that support sockets also support select().  select() can be used to solve many prob‐
       lems in a portable and efficient way that naive programmers try to solve in a more complicated manner  using  threads,  forking,
       IPCs, signals, memory sharing, and so on.

       The  poll(2)  system  call  has  the  same functionality as select(), and is somewhat more efficient when monitoring sparse file
       descriptor sets.  It is nowadays widely available, but historically was less portable than select().

       The Linux-specific epoll(7) API provides an interface that is more efficient than select(2) and poll(2)  when  monitoring  large
       numbers of file descriptors.

       The above program properly forwards most kinds of TCP connections including OOB signal data transmitted by telnet  servers.   It
       handles  the  tricky  problem of having data flow in both directions simultaneously.  You might think it more efficient to use a
       fork(2) call and devote a thread to each stream.  This becomes more tricky than you might suspect.  Another idea is to set  non‐
       blocking I/O using fcntl(2).  This also has its problems because you end up using inefficient timeouts.

       The  program  does  not  handle more than one simultaneous connection at a time, although it could easily be extended to do this
       with a linked list of buffers — one for each connection.  At the moment, new connections cause  the  current  connection  to  be
       dropped.
